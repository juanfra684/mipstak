takeuchi

This is a MIPS64 assembly implementation of Takeuchi's algorithm,
inspired by late night browsing on Nekochan. A C implementation is
included as a baseline.

The assembly is a bit inelegant, but I'm working on that ;). I don't
have command line parsing of arguments in the MIPS64 version; to
change the initial parameters, edit the three words starting at
the label "args".

On my Octane (dual 250 MHz R10K):

<siberia: ~/src/takeuchi> $ make
cc -o ctakeuchi -O2 -pipe  -fPIC  -g -O0 -static takeuchi.c
cc -o atakeuchi -g -O0 -static  -g -O0 -static takeuchi.S
<siberia: ~/src/takeuchi> $ time ./ctakeuchi 18 12 6
nruns: 63609
t: 7

<siberia: ~/src/takeuchi> $ time ./atakeuchi
takeuchi(x=18, y=12, z=6) = 7
    0m0.02s real     0m0.00s user     0m0.01s system
<siberia: ~/src/takeuchi> $ 

That's all for now, folks.
